# NarrativeNew

Narrative is a Kotlin DSL library for creating stories.
Rework of [a previous version](https://github.com/EgorBron/Narrative).

Heavily inspired by [Twine](https://twinery.org/),
[Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) and [Cyberscript](https://github.com/cyberscript77).

Readme will be written later.

The "docs":
* [Format](docs/format.md) features
* [Building stories](docs/build-story.md)
* [Rendering stories](docs/story-renderer.md)
* [Custom serializers](docs/custom-serializers.md) for dynamic metadata
* [Samples](docs/samples.md) of usage
* [Java support](docs/java-support.md) talk
